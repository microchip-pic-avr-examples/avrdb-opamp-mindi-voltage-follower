# Getting started with Mindi simulation using AVR DB

# Configuration: voltage follower
This guide will get you up and running with simulating the analog OPAMP module in AVR DB family devices using the Mindi simulation tool.

## Requirements
Download and install Mindi simulation tool from XXXX
Download and install Mindi model for AVR DB device

## Simulation
Download and open the Mindi schematic from XXX
Press the 'play' button to simulate with a sample source

## Tweaking
Adjust the resistor ladder by XXX

## Updating composer fields
Once the desired result has been verified with Mindi simulation, the corrected values should be moved back into MCC/Start by XXX
