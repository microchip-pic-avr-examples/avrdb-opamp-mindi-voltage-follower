# Getting started with Mindi simulation using AVR DB
This guide will get you up and running with simulating the analog OPAMP module in AVR DB family devices using the Mindi simulation tool.
## Configuration: voltage follower
Voltage follower is an opamp configuration in which the output voltage tracks the input voltage.  Also known as a unity gain amplifier.

### Simulation
Download and open the **Mindi schematic [here](https://github.com/xedbg/Mindi_AVRDB_voltagefollower/releases/download/0.0/VF2.wxsch)**
Press the _play_ button to simulate with a sample source

### Tweaking
Adjust the resistor ladder by XXX

### Updating composer fields
Once the desired result has been verified with Mindi simulation, the corrected values should be moved back into MCC/Start by XXX

### Don't have Mindi?
Download and install Mindi simulation tool from XXXX
Download and install Mindi model for AVR DB device
